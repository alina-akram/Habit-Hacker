# Habit-Hacker
Since it is never too late to build new and re-program old habits; this application is intended to help better organize daily life for Students/Adults. 
The functionality will be simple but the aim is to optimize daily productivity, enforce better habits regarding health, medical reasons or to help build an entirely new routine. 
This would be ideal for Graduate students struggling to achieve the work-school balance, adults requiring necessary updates to their routine to incorporate doctor-recommended lifestyle changes or simply needing to break out of older possibly toxic routines. 
The notification alarms are a good way to enforce reminders and get moving.
